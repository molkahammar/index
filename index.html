            <p>Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
            Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard,
             it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.
             Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]
            Harvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature,
             "dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, 
             in its early years Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. 
             Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century.
            By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.
            [10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869â€“1909),
            the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research
            university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B.
             Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.</p>
